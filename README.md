# DATA-STRUCTURES-IN-PYTHON

A repo with all the codes for different data structures implemented using Python Language.
The Data structures include

  1.Stack

2. Queue

3. Linked List

4. Hash Tables

# Stack 

Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out). There are many real-life examples of a stack. Consider an example of plates stacked over one another in the canteen.

# Queue 

Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first.A real-world example of queue can be a single-lane one-way road, where the vehicle enters first, exits first. More real-world examples can be seen as queues at the ticket windows and bus-stops.

# Linked Lists 

Linked List Basics:
A linked-list is a sequence of data structures which are connected together via links.
Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list the second most used data structure after array. Following are important terms to understand the concepts of Linked List.

Link − Each Link of a linked list can store a data called an element.

Next − Each Link of a linked list contain a link to next link called Next.

LinkedList − A LinkedList contains the connection link to the first Link called First.

# Hash Tables

Hash Table is a data structure which stores data in an associative manner. In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index value. Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data.

Thus, it becomes a data structure in which insertion and search operations are very fast irrespective of the size of the data. Hash Table uses an array as a storage medium and uses hash technique to generate an index where an element is to be inserted or is to be located from.
